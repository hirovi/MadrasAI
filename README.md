# Neural Networks, from basics to complex.
Tutorial that follows the notes from University of Toronto.
I created this repo to practice the basics of machine learning and neural networks.

I'd recommend you follow these notebooks but instead of copying, look at the results of each step and think how would you do it. At the end, this repo is about personal learning.
